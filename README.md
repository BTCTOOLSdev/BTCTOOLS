+ Sorting miners by each field like hash rate, temperature, worker name, etc. You can easily spot abnormal miners with low hash rate or high temperature, etc.
+ With the help of the “Miner Monitoring” function, BTC Tools can constantly update the information of miners. You can quickly find abnormal miners who combine this feature with sorting.
+ Batch setup of miners with their pools, worker names (sub-account.miner-postfix) and passwords or mining difficulties. You can configure all miners or only selected miners.
+ Batch reboot of miners. You can reload all miners or only selected miners.
+ Batch firmware update for all or selected miners.
+ Batch control of miner’s power consumption in L
+ Batch control of the miner’s frequency in overclocking or overclocking mode (available only for Antminer firmware with the “Mode” or “Working mode” drop-down list on the configuration page)
+ Support for most Antminers and part of Avalon miners, including AntminerS17, T17, S9, S7, T9, etc., as well as AvalonA8, A7, A6, etc. (Reboot function is only available for Antminers, scan and configure is available as with Antminers and Avalon Miners.)
## How to use BTCTool
Important! It is worth noting one important feature, which is that to search for an ASIC, you need the ASIC and the computer where you actually launched the program to work on the same network, that is, for example, if you have a wireless wi-fi, then then both the ASIC and the computer must be connected to this wi-fi network.
